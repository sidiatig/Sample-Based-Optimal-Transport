Description: # SamBa OT: A Sample Based Optimal Transport solver
        
        ## Introduction
        This Python package contains code to solve sample based optimal transport problems.
        An introduction to sample based optimal transport can be found here https://math.nyu.edu/faculty/tabak/publications/Kuang-Tabak.pdf .
        
        The code is still in an alpha version, and optimization/new packages will be added in the future.
        
        Requirements are the numpy, scipy packages. It is recommended to have a Python version >= 3.3
        
        ## Contents
        For now the package includes:
        * igd_sover : A nonlinear minimization solver based on implicit gradient descent. Convergence to a global minimizer isn't guaranteed.
        * local_sot : A solver for sample based __local__ optimal transport.
        * sot : A solver for sample based optimal transport.
        * ot_map : Reconstructs the global optimal transport from the outputs of sot
        
        ## Installation
        Downlaod the file sbot-0.1.tar.gz (.zip for windows) located in the 'dist' folder. Run the command 'pip install sbot-0.1.tar.gz', (or 'pip install sbot-0.1.zip') after changing your working directory to where the file is downloaded.
        
        ## Examples
        Examples and explanations are included in the SampleBasedOT.ipynb Jupyter notebook in the 'notebooks' folder.
